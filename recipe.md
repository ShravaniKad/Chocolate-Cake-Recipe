Preheat oven 
In a large bowl, stir together the sugar, flour, cocoa, baking powder, baking soda and salt.
Add the eggs, milk, oil and vanilla, and mix all of them.
Bake 30 to 35 minutes in the preheated oven, until the cake tests done with a toothpick. Cool in the pans, then remove to a wire rack to cool completely.
